# Youtube Clone React JS Project

Stack: MERN

Built this project to learn about react and how to implement a MERN stack applicaiton.
Youtube has been a great resource to me in my dev journey and I thought this was a cool way 
to pay homage. Also this site is not yet fully responsive on mobile. Gonna get to that 
once I get some spare time. 

All the videos are of me explaining different projects/applications I made or am in
the process of making. Sorry if the video seems dry, I say "uh" alot in it. I'll
just say they need some editing forsure.
